          <p class="text-gray-600 text-left">
            Schaefer Auto originated from Caleb’s passion for “flipping”
            vehicles, ATV’s, boats, trailers, etc. He has continued to grow the
            business on his own, while remaining hands on. Caleb works to ensure
            the vehicle inventory is always abundant and diverse, provides
            communication with customers during their vehicle search, and
            facilitates vehicle sales.
